 # HACKTOBERFEST 2022 
  
</div>

## What is Hacktoberfest?
A month-long celebration from October 1st to October 31st presented by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) collaborated with [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2433-celebrate-open-source-this-october-with-hacktoberfest) to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open-source developer community.

[https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

## Rules :fire:
To qualify for the __official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt__, you must register [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and make four Pull Requests (PRs) between October 1-31, 2022 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repository on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. This year, the __first 40,000__ participants who complete Hacktoberfest can opt to receive any one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
